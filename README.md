# Timely Zero

Minimalistic implementation of Naiad paper "A Timely Dataflow System" in Scala.

## Why

Even though the original idea of multidimensional timestamps for progress tracking to allow for cycles in dataflow graph described in the ["Naiad: A Timely Dataflow System"](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/courses/2015/6.S897/readings/naiad.pdf) seems pretty straighforward, understanding of details and implementation techniques might be somewhat... tricky.

The goal of the project is to find a simplest possible implementation of all concepts described in the paper. So the reader does not need to understand 22,700 lines of C# code (estimate from the paper). Another problem with learning the concepts... the reference [Naiad implementation](https://github.com/MicrosoftResearch/Naiad) has both a lot of low level details (e.g. handling network communication between distributed nodes) and higher level frameworks (e.g. GraphLINQ). Those are valueable but they overcomplicate understanding of the basics.

It does not seem like Naiad paper got a lot of industry traction (apart from the fact that some ideas from the paper were used to build architecture foundation for TensorFlow). Newer reincarnation of Timely Dataflow concept is done in Rust here: [timely-dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow). Rust library has much clear approach to defining dataflow primities (e.g. stages, scopes, etc) and relies on the concept of built-in iterables rather than on inheritance. Which makes it somewhat easier to understand the code but the concepts are still hard to grasp without prior learning.

## DOs

The project contains implementation of 2 cases:
* `DistinctCount` from the paper
* `CollatzConjecture` as a simple example of dataflow loops

Message-passing between nodes of the dataflow graph is implemented using Actors (leveraging the simplest actors library ever, [castor](https://github.com/lihaoyi/castor)). Actor-based implementation would definitely suffer from performance problems but the concept of Actors sending messages plays nicely with core idea of dataflow nodes exchanging messages to progress time (Vertex API described in the paper is almost identical to typical Actors systems with `sendBy` and `onRecv`). Also, using message-passing instead of direct state mutation allows us to abstract away the notion that nodes might run on different machines. In this case, more advance libraries like Akka would handle networking keeping the high-level API similar to a single machine execution context.

## DONTs

What was intentionally omitted/skipped/over-simplified:

* single process (no networking, single scheduler)
* data partition between workers/nodes
* debug/tracability (e.g. vertex names, dynamic subscription etc)

## Compile & Run

Just use `sbt`.
